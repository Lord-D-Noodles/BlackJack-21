# BlackJack-21
Simple blackjack game
This project works but was not fully finished. I didn't feel like fully getting split, and double down to work was worth my time when this project was just to lead to me being able to make my own game in python. 

There are two versions of the code, one fully made by me as to how I thought the game worked, the simpleBlackjack.py, and one that was after learning more about how the game works realBlackjack.py. The real blackjack.py was partialy insired by a youtube video.
